## Practical task :

#### 1. Based on AJAX technology, write the client part of the application (HTML + JavaScript), in which when you click the button sends an asynchronous GET-request to the server (you can use XMLHttpRequest or fetch ()), loads the file users.json and reads all information about the user and displayed on an HTML page (see example below).

#### 2. Based on NodeJS technology, create a local http-server that will serve the users.json file. The server must be able to read the users.json file on the appropriate http request. For example, you can use node-static or http-server modules to implement a static server.
